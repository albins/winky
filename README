Winky is an arduino-based (or rather -centric) project for temperature
logging. It uses the SHT15 sensor as input. I described my plan- and goals for
the project on my blog:
http://eval.nu/blog/2010/01/06/winky-an-arduino-based-temperature-logger-project-plan/.

Right now, the code is split into three parts:
* winky.pde - code for the arduino to recieve and forward temperature data
* tempcoll.py - code for recieving and logging data from the arduino via USB tty
* tempplot.py - code for plotting graphs using mathplotlib

Most of it probably isn't very useful yet.
